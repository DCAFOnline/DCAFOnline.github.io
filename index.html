      <h2>The Business Need </h2>          
      <h3>Participation in the digital economy</h3>
      <p>Digital transformation or more aptly called business transformation, has become an imperative for all businesses (small, medium and large).
         It's not just about embracing new technologies, it is more a change in thinking and organisational culture - to usher in
          a positive change and to optimise business operations/activities, lower cost and improve time to market. One such area is in 
          the procure to pay (buyer's perspective) or order to cash (supplier's) lifecycle, where buyers and suppliers are constantly exchanging procurement related
           documentation - businesses now want to do this digitally. They want to be digital on the inside and digital on the outside.</p>  

              <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <div class="card fadeInLeft wow animated">

                            Electronic invoicing (eInvoicing) is a good first step!
                          </div>  <!-- card-header-->
                        <div class="card-body">

                                <p class="card-text" >
                                 Invoicing is part of the accounts payable stage of the procure to pay lifecycle. eInvoicing is the exchange
                                  and processing of the invoice document between a supplier’s and a buyer’s systems in an integrated (structured)
                                   electronic format. Invoice data issued in emailed PDF, Excel spreadsheets and word documents or scanned paper 
                                   invoices are not considered as eInvoices. eInvoicing has now become more synonymous with maximising the automation
                                    of the accounts payable stage.
                                  </p>

                  <p>Large enterprises usually operate accross the full continuum of the procure to pay lifecycle. The vast majority
                    of businesses (small businesses) usually focus more on the accounts receivable and accounts payable stages. Every business
                     has trading partners (buyer/s and supplier/s). Businesses exchange procurement information (documents) in some form or the other
                      with their trading partners. The most common activities between trading partners are invoicing,
                      payments and remittances.</p>

                How does DCAFOnline meet business needs?
              </h3>
  
            <p>
              Business management or accounting systems have recently become very popular and cost effective to generate, exchange and process
               digital documents such as invoices. When systems exchange information digitally it is important that they all speak the same
                technical language. This includes:
            </p>
             <ul>
               <li> being able to discover the digital address of the trading partner's system</li>
               <li> structuring and transmitting the document in a way it can be recieved and understood without errors</li>
             </ul>
             <p>The common language these systems speak, making them digitally interoperable, are based on technology standards. 
             In many cases these standards are packaged with sets of policies and guidelines as an Interoperability Framework. Such frameworks 
              assist software or service providers in building digital interoperability into their products.
            </p>
              <br>
              <p>DCAFOnline is designed to help vendors publish their compliance with such Frameworks and hence give businesses 
                visibility on which software or services are compliant with these frameworks. Business can then use the DCAFOnline
                 results to inform their software/ service purchasing decisions or to support requests for interoperability features
                  from their existing providers.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>DCAFOnline is currently undergoing beta testing. All businesses will have free access once it is launched. Please contact
                 us should you wish to be further updated.

    <!-- /Call to Action -->

  <section class="lightcyan-bk" id="about">
    <div class="container text-left text-white">
      <h2>Why DCAFOnline?</h2>
      <p>There is little doubt that standards or interoperability frameworks are fundamental to enabling digital interoperability.
         Ensuring they are used in a prescribed way, through governance or other mechanisms , is more important. Governance is the
           glue that makes interoperability work. Given the diverse range of digital standards in use, there is inevitably
           going to be gaps in assessing digital service providers' adherence to an interoperability framework or organised
            collection of standards. Some of these gaps include:</p>
      <ul>
           <li>The usual absence of a single certification, regulation or suitable compliance regime that governs the use of a
              framework or suite of standards. Such compliance generally adds more cost and complexity; </li>
           <li>A lack of an authoritative governance body on cross industry initiatives led by informal multi-stakeholder forums;</li>
           <li>The unusual practice for a government authority to provide accreditation or certification to private sector
                 organisations for the use of standards or frameworks that do not fall within its regulatory scope;</li>
           <li>Formal accreditation as only a snapshot at the time it is granted. Unless there are guarantees that
              software environments do not change and there is a practical way to prove this, the accreditation can only be taken
               on faith. Data relevant to the accreditation has a tendency to get outdated and needs to be periodically reviewed and
                updated, often resulting in manually intensive work; and</li>
            <li>Organisations that publish standards or frameworks and also provide certification of compliance (accreditation)
                 run the risk of transgressing anti-competitive regulations or laws.</li>
      </ul>
            <p>These gaps, if left unaddressed, can be expected to significantly inhibit market adoption. There needs to be a simple and
           cost-effective way for businesses to determine or evaluate whether their providers support an organised collection of
            standards (or frameworks) and for service providers to voluntarily and transparently publish their credentials
             as a set of digital capability assertions. DCAFOnline is based on a Digital Capability Assertion Framework (DCAF). The approach uses
              transparency as a governance and compliance tool to help facilitate and enable self-regulation of a digitally interoperable ecosystem.
              Transparency, used in the DCAF prescribed manner, will hold participants to the highest level of service and business conduct. 
            </p>
            <br>
             <p>DCAF has been designed to provide foundational capabilities in support of interoperability frameworks intended for many vertical
                industries - extensibility by design.</p>

                    DCAFOnline facilitates and enables service providers to publish their digital capability assertions in a transparent and
                     uniform manner. It uses the Digital Capability Assertion Framework ™ (DCAF), a multi-tiered or multi-levelled approach,
                      which specifies a set of criteria for a particular initiative. DCAFOnline is designed to support many initiatives, for
                       example the Digital Business Council’s eInvoicing initiative. Any service provider may request inclusion of 
                        support for new initiatives. The levels are:

                   <i> Provisional.</i>
                    The level3+ approach is designed-in as an extensibility option to reduce duplication and unnecessary costs being imposed on digital service providers.
